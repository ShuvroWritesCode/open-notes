This is nothing revolutionary. This is a simple, browser-based, quick note-taking tool that does what I needed it to do. With AI everywhere, I added a basic AI assist so I don’t have to copy and paste my notes into ChatGPT for quick explanations. If that sounds like something you’d find useful too, it’s here for you.
